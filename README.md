# Ising-model
Implement 2D Ising model using mean field theory, Onsager's formula and Monte Carlo simulation. Course project of Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics.

# To use the code
1. Clone the repository
2. Run <simulation.py> (Might take hours)
3. Run <plot_cv.py> to plot specific heat.
4. Run <plot_mag.py> to plot magnetization.
5. Figures are saved in folder ./Figures
